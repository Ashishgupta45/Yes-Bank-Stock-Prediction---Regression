<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Description</h2>

Analyzing the data of yes bank stock price. data from 2005 to 2020.
We have been given the data of Yes Bank stocks prices. Our first aim to understand the, what is stock market? How it works actually? And basic terminologies like stock opening price, closing, high, low etc. Our second aim is to identify actionable insights from our data and use basic analysis to give conclusions about key aspect of our data.
      Our problem statement was, "Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month".

 <h2> :floppy_disk: Dataset Overview</h2>

What is stock?

A Stock or share (also known as a company’s 'equity') is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company. Units of stock are called "shares." Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges, though there can be private sales as well, and are the foundation of many individual investors' portfolios.

Since, we've the YES BANK Stock price dataset which has the monthly stock prices. It contains the following features:

Open - The opening price is the price at which a security first trades upon the opening of an exchange on a trading day i.e. buyers and sellers meet to make deals with the highest bidder, the opening price may not have to be the same as the last day's closing price.

High - The high is the highest price at which a stock traded during a period.

Low -The low is the highest price at which a stock traded during a period.

Close -The closing price is a stock's trading price at the end of a trading day. This makes it the most recent price of a stock until the next trading session. The closing price is calculated as the weighted average price of the last 30 minutes, i.e. from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM in case of equity.

<h2> :book: </h2>
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning (DL). Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDSs (intrusion detection systems).

A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.

LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.
